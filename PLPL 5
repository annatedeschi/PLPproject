Objects or Similar Structures:

Yes, Perl supports objects, but it's not as strict as in some languages.

Naming Conventions:
No strict conventions, but using $self for instance variables is common.

Standard Methods:
No strict standards like Java or Python, but methods like bless and DESTROY are used.

Inheritance:
Yes, Perl supports inheritance. Multiple inheritance is possible but a bit complex.

Overloading Method Names:
Possible, but not as enforced as in some languages. Derived class methods override base class methods.

Other Info:
Perl's OOP is flexible. Modules like Moose and Moo add advanced features.
Perl's approach is less strict, giving more freedom but requiring discipline.
